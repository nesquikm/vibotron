Based on rules:

<rules_all>
{rules_all}
</rules_all>

create a verification prompt on behalf of the user to evaluate
<rule>
{rule}
</rule>

The verification prompt should be in the user's preferred language.

The verification prompt should be a single question or statement that can be answered with a short response.

The output should be a user prompt, nothing else.
